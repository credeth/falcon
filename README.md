# CredEth

Credeth is an open reputation protocol. The reputation in credeth works like credit score and can be used to give an idea of person's social standing without exposing their real Identity. It aims to make onchain governance easier.

#### Why?

Reputation is a necessary part of the real world, but there is no onchain global reputation source. Credeth enables developers to implement Sybil protection and analyze someone's credibility. For example, it can be used by a lending protocol to lend money onchain by using reputation as a credit score. It can also be used by a new dApp to airdrop their tokens and for signaling/weighted voting.

#### Getting Started

It's Simple
